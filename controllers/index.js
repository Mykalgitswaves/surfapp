let coordinates = []
let boeys = []


// we are going to need to get coordinates based off of a map pin using some type of map api
// then we will run a callback to getClosestBoey with coordinates as an arguments.


// ouput of getClosestBoey will be an array of Boeys that will be parsed on the client side.
// we can go through each boey and create live data feeds for each (going to be a shit ton of work).
