Requirements
    We are building a surf report app that takes a users homebreak and
    queries noaa boeys for the closest boeys to that location. 
    each user will have a schema that resembles the following:

    surfer: {
        homebreak: coordinates(STRING)
    }
    
    a boey needs to relay wave height for a given beach, 
    it would be dope if it could also supply 
    users with  

    #TODO: get more familiar with NOAA OUTPUT. maybe figure out the strucutre of their boeys and see if I can query one to start?? 
    Boey: {
        
    }

    relations

    One surfer has many boeys and one boey has one surfer

    OTHER IDEA THAT COULD BE FUN TO PLAY AROUND WITH MAYBE LATER??
    It would be rad if you could sync this with google calendar to create a meeting when you are not busy and there are waves! Created from a preset of a few options you can select from

    #TODO: so you would have wave height on the front end depending on your calendar
